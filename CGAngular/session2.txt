        BrowserModule
        AppRoutingModule
    Angular Material Library
        MatButtonModule
    All the code and functionality is grouped in a module

    whenever you see @ symbol - it's a decorator

    what module consists of:
        declarations:   
            this is where we will add all the components of the module
        imports:
            we can import modules inside a module
        providers

        Bootstrap:
            what is the first component, the module should load
        exports:
            is to export and expose the component outside of the module
    Every angular application should have atleast one module (AppModule)
