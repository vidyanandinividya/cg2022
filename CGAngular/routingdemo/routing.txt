Router Outlet
    it is a built-in directive
    Every angular app should have atleast one router Outlet
    in app.component.html (by default)

    common mistakes:
        1. adding "/" in path
        2. component names in qoutes ""
        3. bad formed array of routes
we can define multiple outlets by giving name to them
that's y we call them named router outlet
it will not show if you directky access it in the URL
syntax:
http://localhost:4200/<primary-outlet>(<routerOutletName>:<secondaryPath>)

ng g m app-routing --flat --module=app

routerlink
    when it applied to an element in a template, makes that element a link that initiates naviagtion to a route

    it can be static or dynamic

    <a [RouterLink]="/loans"></a>


Redirect routes
    by default the root level is ' '
    redirectTo and specify which route it has to go
wildcard routes
    any unmatched route will be intercepted by wild card route
    this has to be the last route in your configuration
    we define by saying the path to match "**"
