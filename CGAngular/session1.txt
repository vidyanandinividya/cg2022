Angular JS vs Angular 

Angular 6
    node .js 
    npm install -g @angular/cli   -- used to install angular
    npm install -g typescript       -- used to install typescript

To check the version 
    ng --version 
    or
    npm run ng -v 

To create Angular Project 
    ng new projectname    -- git installed with the project 
    ng new projectname --skip-git
To open the angular project in VS code -- 
code .

To run the project
ng serve

or
npm start

or 

ng serve -open

typescript
    it's just a superset of JavaScript
    it cannot be rendered in browser directly
    once it gets compiled gives you the js file

Angular Component
    these are the most basic UI building blocks of an Angular App.

    ng g c component-name

    Template
        defines the layput and content of the view.
        these are the html files (Angular Template Syntax)
    - provide an external template (templateUrl)
    - Defining the template inline
Data Binding
    the way of communication between view (template) and code (typescript)
        one way Binding
            output data from the typescript code in HTML template 
                string interpolation
                property binding
                event binding

        two way binding
            combine both the directions
